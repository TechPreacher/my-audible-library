Djèlí Clark</b></p> <p>In a strange little home built into the branches of a grove of trees, live three robots—fatherly inventor android Giovanni Lawson, a pleasantly sadistic nurse machine, and a small vacuum desperate for love and attention. Victor Lawson, a human, lives there too. They’re a family, hidden and safe.</p> <p>The day Vic salvages and repairs an unfamiliar android labelled “HAP,” he learns of a shared dark past between Hap and Gio–a past spent hunting humans.</p> <p>When Hap unwittingly alerts robots from Gio’s former life to their whereabouts, the family is no longer hidden and safe. Gio is captured and taken back to his old laboratory in the City of Electric Dreams. So together, the rest of Vic’s assembled family must journey across an unforgiving and otherworldly country to rescue Gio from decommission, or worse, reprogramming.</p> <p>Along the way to save Gio, amid conflicted feelings of betrayal and affection for Hap, Vic must decide for himself: Can he accept love with strings attached?</p> <p>Inspired by Carlo Collodi's <i>The Adventures of Pinocchio</i>, and like <i>Swiss Family Robinson</i> meets <i>Wall-E</i>, <i>In the Lives of Puppets</i> is a masterful stand-alone fantasy adventure from the beloved author who brought you <i>The House in the Cerulean Sea</i> and <i>Under the Whispering Door.</i></p> <p>★ “An epic quest of rescue and discovery [with] the author’s trademark charm, heart, and bittersweetness.”—<i>Library Journal</i>, starred review</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Tor Books.</b></p>";
