Aurelius Venport and Norma Cenva are on the verge of the most important discovery in human history-a way to \"fold\" space and travel instantaneously to any place in the galaxy.<br><br>And on the faraway, nearly worthless planet of Arrakis, Selim Wormrider and his band of outlaws take the first steps to making themselves the feared fighters who will change the course of history: the Fremen.<br><br>Here is the unrivaled imaginative power that has put Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson on bestseller lists everywhere and earned them the high regard of readers around the globe.
