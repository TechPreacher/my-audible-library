window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Not far in the future, the seas have risen, and the central latitudes are emptying. But it's still a good time to be rich in San Francisco, where weapons drones patrol the skies to keep out the multitudinous poor. </p> <p>Irina isn't rich, not quite, but she does have an artificial memory that gives her perfect recall and lets her act as a medium between her various employers and their AIs, which are complex to the point of opacity. It's a good gig, paying enough for the annual visits to the Mayo Clinic that keep her from aging. </p> <p>Kern has no such access; he's one of the many refugees in the sprawling drone-built favelas on the city's periphery, where he lives like a monk, training relentlessly in martial arts, scraping by as a thief and an enforcer. Thales is from a different world entirely - the mathematically inclined scion of a Brazilian political clan, he's fled to LA after the attack that left him crippled and his father dead. </p> <p>A ragged stranger accosts Thales and demands to know how much he can remember. Kern flees for his life after robbing the wrong mark. Irina finds a secret in the reflection of a laptop's screen in her employer's eyeglasses. None is safe as they're pushed together by subtle forces that stay just out of sight. </p> <p>Vivid, tumultuous, and propulsive, <i>Void Star</i> is Zachary Mason's mind-bending follow-up to his critically acclaimed novel <i>The Lost Books of the Odyssey</i>. </p>";
