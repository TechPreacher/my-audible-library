He vastly prefers the countless science-fiction movies, books, and videogames he's spent his life consuming. And too often, he catches himself wishing that some fantastic, impossible, world-altering event could arrive to whisk him off on a grand spacefaring adventure. <br><br>So when he sees the flying saucer, he's sure his years of escapism have finally tipped over into madness. <br><br>Especially because the alien ship he's staring at is straight out of his favorite videogame, a flight simulator callled <i>Armada—</i>in which gamers just happen to be protecting Earth from alien invaders. <br><br>As impossible as it seems, what Zack's seeing is all too real.
